Description: Suggests possible exploits based on kernel version
 This program run without arguments will perform a 'uname -r'
 to grab the Linux Operating Systems release version, and 
 return a suggestive list of possible exploits. Nothing 
 fancy, so a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script.
